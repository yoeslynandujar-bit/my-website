Project #1: Open Source Tools and Writing with MyST

Open source tools and open source digital composing gives digital writers enormous control over their words. This project asks you to experiment with open source tools, including the open source publishing platform MyST, and reflect on your experience.

In class, we will work through a series of lessons ("episodes") that teach open source tools and open source composing. Try your best to complete the lessons, then reflect on your challenges and what you learned in a multimodal essay.
